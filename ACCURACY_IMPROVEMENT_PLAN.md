# Stock Price Prediction Accuracy Improvement Plan
### Achieving Maximum Prediction Accuracy through Advanced 2024-2025 Techniques

## üîç Current System Analysis - Critical Limitations Found

### Architecture Limitations
1. **Basic Transformer Implementation**: Current model uses standard transformer with only 4 layers and 8 attention heads
2. **Single Domain Learning**: Only processes time domain data, missing frequency domain patterns
3. **No Market Correlation**: Each stock predicted in isolation without considering market correlations
4. **Limited Feature Engineering**: Basic technical indicators only (RSI, MACD, SMA)
5. **Static Learning**: No incremental learning for evolving market conditions
6. **No Sentiment Integration**: Missing news sentiment and social media data

### Data Quality Issues
1. **Insufficient External Context**: Only uses Yahoo Finance OHLCV data
2. **Missing Alternative Data**: No news, social media, economic indicators
3. **Basic Scaling**: Simple MinMax scaling causes prediction range limitations
4. **No Market Regime Detection**: Model doesn't adapt to bull/bear market transitions

### Training Limitations
1. **Basic Loss Function**: Only MSE loss, no directional accuracy optimization
2. **No Portfolio Optimization**: Single stock focus without portfolio metrics
3. **Limited Validation**: No time series cross-validation or walk-forward analysis
4. **Fixed Architecture**: No hyperparameter optimization or architecture search
